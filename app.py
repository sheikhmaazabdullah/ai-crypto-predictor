            |---------------|------------|----------------------------|-------|
            | **ARIMA** | Statistical| Close price only           | Best for linear time series, captures trends and seasonality. |
            | **Linear Regression** | ML         | OHLCV + Indicators         | Simple, fast, and interpretable. Good baseline. |
            | **LSTM** | Deep Learning | OHLCV + Indicators         | Excellent for sequential data, captures long-term dependencies. |
            | **Transformer** | Deep Learning | OHLCV + Indicators         | Powerful for capturing complex relationships and attention mechanisms in time series. |
            | **Ensemble** | Combined   | Predictions from all above | Averages predictions from all trained individual models for robustness. |
            üîí All models use a configurable lookback period (default 60 steps), scaled inputs (MinMax), and predict a configurable number of future candles.
            ## üìà How to Interpret Predictions
            - Predicted prices are shown as dashed lines extending from the chart.
            - Use **support/resistance** levels, **trend** analysis, and **indicator signals** to validate the prediction.
            - Combine with **order book** data and **sentiment** for a more confident trading decision.
            ## üß† Understanding Buy/Sell Zones
            - Based on thresholds from indicators like RSI and Bollinger Bands.
            - Shown as green/red zones or triangle markers on charts.
            - **Buy Signal**: Often triggered by an oversold RSI, price touching lower Bollinger Band, or a bullish MA crossover.
            - **Sell Signal**: Often triggered by an overbought RSI, price touching upper Bollinger Band, or a bearish MA crossover.
            ## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting & Known Issues
            - **No Data?** Ensure the selected symbol/timeframe is valid for the chosen exchange.
            - **Database Connection Failed?** Check your credentials and ensure the database server is accessible. The app will run without persistence if connection fails.
            - **No sentiment?** Ensure a valid NewsAPI key is provided in the sidebar.
            - **Too few candles?** Adjust the "Prediction Horizon" slider or select a longer timeframe in the sidebar.
            - **Mobile UI glitch?** The app includes basic responsiveness, but complex charts may still require desktop for optimal viewing.
            ## üí° Future Plans
            - Real trading API integration (with secure key management).
            - Advanced alerts/notifications (e.g., Telegram, Email integration).
            - More sophisticated hyperparameter optimization for all models.
            - Comprehensive trading journal exports and CSV reports.
            - Automated strategy backtest optimizer and auto-selector.
            ## üì¨ Support
            - Raise a GitHub issue or contact the development team.
            - Suggestions and Pull Requests are always welcome!
